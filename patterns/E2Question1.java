//    Problem Description
//
//    Your younger brother is going to a modern school. In his school, there was a coding competition planned. The pannel asked a question "Write a program which can perform the task - Add two numbers and divide them by a third number and print the remainder".
//    You are a programmer and your brother asks you to write a code that helps him to check his approach.
//
//
//    Problem Constraints
//
//0 <= N1, N2 <= 10000000
//            1 <= N3 <= 10000000
//
//
//    Input Format
//
//    First line is number N1.
//
//    Second line is number N2.
//
//    Third line is number N3.
//
//
//
//            Output Format
//
//    Print the value of remainder.
